# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Nick Armstrong

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 31st, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started in on the freecodecamp front-end curriculum since it's been a while. Super basic stuff but feels good to get my fingers moving and like visiting old friends. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/947722929285902336

### R1D2
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Got through CSS fundamentals and am now looking at hex colors. And I finally understand how hex applies to colors as well which is pretty great. Great start to the new year! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948053929572450304

### R1D3
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Starting in on the JQuery Playground which will probably make more sense later on. Also learned about bootstrap and font awesome which are nice, free resources but makes me wonder whether all web design will look super-homogenous after a while and whether that's necessarily a bad thing. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948426863252131841

### R1D4
Finished up the tutorials and now moving on to building something with CodePen. Things are getting real now... https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948778307096477699

### R1D5
Started working on my tribute page in codepen. Lots of referencing back and forth and agonizing over boostrap 3 versus 4 - decided to go with 4. Slow going but (re)learning to reference docs to quickly find what I need. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949169542135074816

### R1D6
Finished up the tribute page to King Bhumibol - https://codepen.io/nickarms/pen/aEyQwJ. And yes I tweeted about it - https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949525498828242944

### R1D7
Officially one week in - woo hoo! Starting in on the portfolio page now. Need to stay focused on delivering something versus delivering something perfect; perfect is the enemy of good - https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949899086731214848

### R1D8
Unproductive day today in terms of actual delivery but learned an important lesson about BootStrap and semi-colons, namely DON'T USE THEM!!! Anyhow, tomorow is day one. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/950231450489569281

### R1D9
Still slow-going but learning about BootStrap in the process, although not sure how much of it is really sticking since I'm covering a LOT of material. Time will tell... https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/950637488850190336

### R1D10
Didn't code yesterday but went ~1 hour the previous day so I feel okay about it. Also, the fact that I bothered to take my laptop to Maui to code while I'm here speaks (I think) to my commitment. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/951714140401254400

### R1D11
2nd day of coding in paradise. Going well all things considered. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/952093333995732994

### R1D12
3rd day of coding in paradise and did it in bed because it's annoying Angie. Finished the portolio page exercise and now moving on to JavaScript which should be harder but less tweezy which I'm looking forward to. Also, I need to make sure to correct my twitter entries starting tomorrow since I'm a day behind. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/952486035539152896

### R1D13
4th day of coding in paradise and still happy to be back on JS working through arrays and variables and wondering how it's going to be this time around. Hit an absolute WALL today so probably coded ~5 minutes or so shy of an hour but I'm okay with it since it was a long day of hiking up to Haleakela. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/952826392483315712

### R1D14
Short day today but I'm exhausted from crossfit ~6 hours of driving and have to get up at 5:45 for diving - some vacation! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/953169394347122688

### R1D15
Once again shy of an hour but since I literally coded until I was falling asleep at the keyboard I feel okay about it. Still working my way through JavaScript and excited/nervous about the exercises I know are coming. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/953557072649400321

### R1D16
Miracle I did some coding today considering how late it is. Guess it says something about my commitment to this thing - right? Now getting into JavaScript objects; just keeps getting juicier. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/953934258673864704

### R1D17
The tweet says it all. Hit a wall trying to add an object to an array. Am I supposed to do it right inline or with a function call or what? I was chugging right along and then WHAM! I know this is the first of many walls hit and pushing through will be an important thing for me so I persevere. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/954255986314829824

### R1D18
JS loops and complex arrays. Also, yesterday's wall turned out to be an error in the example/instructional code which really should be fixed but served as an opportunity to engage the community who had run into the same issue with the exercise. Also, got lots of supportive responses to my tweet. Good stuff! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/954641498351398912

### R1D19
Argh slow going today and making things unecessarily complicated for myself. I am learning, though, and refusing to give up so it's exercising good muscles. Need to get better at enforcing boundaries for how late I'm staying up, though - this is not sustainable. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/955020793116676096

### R1D20
Got through the object array fiasco from yesterday with fresh eyes today but took me nearly the entire hour and the code I wrote was laughable, though it did get the job done so it's in the rear view mirror now. Oh, and has it really been 20 days already? Holy sh##t! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/955313720128815104
