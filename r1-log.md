## Log

### R1D1 
Started in on the freecodecamp front-end curriculum since it's been a while. Super basic stuff but feels good to get my fingers moving and like visiting old friends. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/947722929285902336

### R1D2
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Got through CSS fundamentals and am now looking at hex colors. And I finally understand how hex applies to colors as well which is pretty great. Great start to the new year! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948053929572450304

### R1D3
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Starting in on the JQuery Playground which will probably make more sense later on. Also learned about bootstrap and font awesome which are nice, free resources but makes me wonder whether all web design will look super-homogenous after a while and whether that's necessarily a bad thing. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948426863252131841

### R1D4
Finished up the tutorials and now moving on to building something with CodePen. Things are getting real now... https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948778307096477699

### R1D5
Started working on my tribute page in codepen. Lots of referencing back and forth and agonizing over boostrap 3 versus 4 - decided to go with 4. Slow going but (re)learning to reference docs to quickly find what I need. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949169542135074816

### R1D6
Finished up the tribute page to King Bhumibol - https://codepen.io/nickarms/pen/aEyQwJ. And yes I tweeted about it - https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949525498828242944

### R1D7
Officially one week in - woo hoo! Starting in on the portfolio page now. Need to stay focused on delivering something versus delivering something perfect; perfect is the enemy of good.
