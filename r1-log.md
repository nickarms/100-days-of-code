The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 31st, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started in on the freecodecamp front-end curriculum since it's been a while. Super basic stuff but feels good to get my fingers moving and like visiting old friends.

### R1D2
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Got through CSS fundamentals and am now looking at hex colors. And I finally understand how hex applies to colors as well which is pretty great. Great start to the new year!
