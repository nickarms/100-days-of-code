# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Nick Armstrong

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 31st, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started in on the freecodecamp front-end curriculum since it's been a while. Super basic stuff but feels good to get my fingers moving and like visiting old friends.

### R1D2
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Got through CSS fundamentals and am now looking at hex colors. And I finally understand how hex applies to colors as well which is pretty great. Great start to the new year!

### R1D3
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Starting in on the JQuery Playground which will probably make more sense later on. Also learned about bootstrap and font awesome which are nice, free resources but makes me wonder whether all web design will look super-homogenous after a while and whether that's necessarily a bad thing.
