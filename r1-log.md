# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Nick Armstrong

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 31st, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started in on the freecodecamp front-end curriculum since it's been a while. Super basic stuff but feels good to get my fingers moving and like visiting old friends. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/947722929285902336

### R1D2
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Got through CSS fundamentals and am now looking at hex colors. And I finally understand how hex applies to colors as well which is pretty great. Great start to the new year! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948053929572450304

### R1D3
Continued with the freecodecamp front-end stuff. Starting in on the JQuery Playground which will probably make more sense later on. Also learned about bootstrap and font awesome which are nice, free resources but makes me wonder whether all web design will look super-homogenous after a while and whether that's necessarily a bad thing. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948426863252131841

### R1D4
Finished up the tutorials and now moving on to building something with CodePen. Things are getting real now... https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/948778307096477699

### R1D5
Started working on my tribute page in codepen. Lots of referencing back and forth and agonizing over boostrap 3 versus 4 - decided to go with 4. Slow going but (re)learning to reference docs to quickly find what I need. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949169542135074816

### R1D6
Finished up the tribute page to King Bhumibol - https://codepen.io/nickarms/pen/aEyQwJ. And yes I tweeted about it - https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949525498828242944

### R1D7
Officially one week in - woo hoo! Starting in on the portfolio page now. Need to stay focused on delivering something versus delivering something perfect; perfect is the enemy of good - https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/949899086731214848

### R1D8
Unproductive day today in terms of actual delivery but learned an important lesson about BootStrap and semi-colons, namely DON'T USE THEM!!! Anyhow, tomorow is day one. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/950231450489569281

### R1D9
Still slow-going but learning about BootStrap in the process, although not sure how much of it is really sticking since I'm covering a LOT of material. Time will tell... https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/950637488850190336

### R1D10
Didn't code yesterday but went ~1 hour the previous day so I feel okay about it. Also, the fact that I bothered to take my laptop to Maui to code while I'm here speaks (I think) to my commitment. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/951714140401254400

### R1D11
2nd day of coding in paradise. Going well all things considered. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/952093333995732994

### R1D12
3rd day of coding in paradise and did it in bed because it's annoying Angie. Finished the portolio page exercise and now moving on to JavaScript which should be harder but less tweezy which I'm looking forward to. Also, I need to make sure to correct my twitter entries starting tomorrow since I'm a day behind. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/952486035539152896

### R1D13
4th day of coding in paradise and still happy to be back on JS working through arrays and variables and wondering how it's going to be this time around. Hit an absolute WALL today so probably coded ~5 minutes or so shy of an hour but I'm okay with it since it was a long day of hiking up to Haleakela. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/952826392483315712

### R1D14
Short day today but I'm exhausted from crossfit ~6 hours of driving and have to get up at 5:45 for diving - some vacation! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/953169394347122688

### R1D15
Once again shy of an hour but since I literally coded until I was falling asleep at the keyboard I feel okay about it. Still working my way through JavaScript and excited/nervous about the exercises I know are coming. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/953557072649400321

### R1D16
Miracle I did some coding today considering how late it is. Guess it says something about my commitment to this thing - right? Now getting into JavaScript objects; just keeps getting juicier. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/953934258673864704

### R1D17
The tweet says it all. Hit a wall trying to add an object to an array. Am I supposed to do it right inline or with a function call or what? I was chugging right along and then WHAM! I know this is the first of many walls hit and pushing through will be an important thing for me so I persevere. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/954255986314829824

### R1D18
JS loops and complex arrays. Also, yesterday's wall turned out to be an error in the example/instructional code which really should be fixed but served as an opportunity to engage the community who had run into the same issue with the exercise. Also, got lots of supportive responses to my tweet. Good stuff! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/954641498351398912

### R1D19
Argh slow going today and making things unecessarily complicated for myself. I am learning, though, and refusing to give up so it's exercising good muscles. Need to get better at enforcing boundaries for how late I'm staying up, though - this is not sustainable. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/955020793116676096

### R1D20
Got through the object array fiasco from yesterday with fresh eyes today but took me nearly the entire hour and the code I wrote was laughable, though it did get the job done so it's in the rear view mirror now. Oh, and has it really been 20 days already? Holy sh##t! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/955313720128815104

### R1D21
Object-oriented programming - yay! Comparing strings and arrays with weird, esoteric functions - boo! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/955688608622551040

### R1D22
Tackling some new problem solving challenges with strings and arrays and math stuff - fun! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/956044412685078528

### R1D23
Finshed the factorial problem and now am hacking around with regular expressions which are tricky. Maybe this time I'll finally get them. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/956398296766889984

### R1D24
Didn't code yesterday. Did today (more regexp). Asked for feedback from the community on whether I should reset and am okay either way. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/957163033872146432

### R1D25
Coding after a couple hours of bouldering and I'm WIPED! Still chunking away through reversing a string and it's amazing how many false starts I've had. Hope this stuff gets easier (or at least different). https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/957534393110691841

### R1D26
Feeling a tad smarter after today - finished up the string reversal problem (why was this so hard for me?) and started and finished another one in the same day. Now stuck on a third one that's a variation on a theme. Feels like these should be getting easier and they're maybe a little easier (emphasis on little) but I still feel like something is eluding me. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/957852693489377280

### R1D27
I think a regular expression is going to be the way to solve this capitalization problem. Either that or I'm trying to squeeze a round peg into a square hole. Once I see a nicely-crafted regular expression it's really hard to see any other solution, though. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/958234677440999424

### R1D28
Coded for 30 minutes tonight but got through 2 problems (completed one, started and finished another) so I feel like my work is done for tonight. Didn't want to do it at all but glad I pushed myself. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/958601889263865856

### R1D29
Coded for ~30 minutes again but it was a good 30 minutes. Tried things on 2 instances that felt like they should work - and they did! Very confidence-inspiring. Also, Day 29??? Holy shit! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/958951736349147136

### R1D30
Day 30 - woop woop! Multidimensional arrays - meh. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/959325423170592769

### R1D31
The amount of time it takes me to figure out the math on how to offset some of the math on these arrays is not encouraging - really feel like I'm just guessing/trying/testing. Suppose this is part of the process but today felt hard. But hey, day 31 right? https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/959697552609198080

### R1D32
Functions are starting to behave strangely. Time to call it a night. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/960073040200519680

### R1D33
I was a mess last night clearly. Typos and poor reading comprehension were not doing me any favors. Tonight was much better but my fingers hurt from bouldering. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/960409933345783808

### R1D34
Fuck this shit tonight - https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/960790396560277504

### R1D35
Turned to the forums finally and ended up using filter on Boolean to strip out all the falseys. Worked like a charm and was *much* more efficient than my code. Still don't understand why the !isNaN test wasn't working, though. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/961110739732914177

### R1D36
Having a lot of 'fuck this' days lately. Today was another one of those. Ugh. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/961505324426346496

### R1D37
Leveraged a previously unexplored function to save the day - Array.includes(). The code itself was crap but it got the job done and got me on to the next exercise which is what matters most to me at this point. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/961853553508667395

### R1D38
Took a couple days off to go snowmobiling. Probably breaks the rules technically but I feel okay about it and definitely better than taking my laptop and putting up with shit for 2 days solid about it. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/962912081631588352

### R1D39
Caesar's cipher. Who knew shifting letters over by 13 could be so hard? https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/963314296930234369

### R1D40
Still working on Caesar's cipher. Struggling. Doesn't seem like it should be this hard. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/963669171585372161

### R1D41
So close to figuring out Caesar's cipher. Definitely making it harder than it is but I'm closing in on the solution and it's gonna feel goooood when I do. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/964040175494905861

### R1D42
Finally finished Caesar's cipher which I made way harder than it needed to be. Learned how to use regex.test, though, so that was cool. Have a feeling I'll be using that one again in the future. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/964397968177557505

### R1D42
Doing day 42 twice to match what's on twitter. Don't know which one is right and too tired to care right now. Started in on JQuery but too tired to make much sense of it. Will resume tomomorrow. Out. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/964738079561891840

### R1D43
Hacked/copied my way through the JQuery tutorials and now head-first into the deep end of the random quote generator which has very vague requirements but I'm guessing I need to pull quotes from some API somewhere using JQuery and spit them out on a page in a way that makes them look pretty. This is going to be a long haul... https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/965117152033366017

### R1D44
Slow going. JSON syntax is strange. Also spent most of my time looking at cars. Need to do more actual coding tomorrow. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/965525589552541696

### R1D46
No idea why twitter doesn't match GitHub today and too tired to care. Not having a great time with JSON, not sleeping enough, etc. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/966579855088263168

### R1D47
Now running into cross-site CORS somethingorother. Close to throwing in the towel but gonna give it one more day. Argh! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/966934117974663168

### R1D48
Still with the JQuery. Still sucking. Ugh. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/967331349773238273

### R1D49
Still JQuery. Still learning. Still hard. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/967661535769198592

### R1D50
Figured out the cross-site CORS stuff and that it wasn't my script - it was the server. Probably shouldn't have taken me a week to figure that out but whatever. Also embracing the 'marathon-ness' of this thing and accepting that I'm going to get as far as I get and that's that. I'm now successfully calling an API with AJAX and now have to dig deeper into JQUERY so that I really understand what the hell I'm doing rather than just copy/pasting my way to finishing this exercise. Also, I think it's worth mentioning that I'm now officially halfway through this thing on my birthday which feels appropriate. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/968367686060269569

### R1D51
Can't overstate how good it feels to be making progress again, albeit on basic JQuery. If I'm going to do any actual work in this space I'm going to need a solid understanding of it so better buck up. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/968754324280086528

### R1D52
Continuing with JQuery animation stuff. Really cool and feels good to be making forward progress and it's already making more sense how I'm gonna stich the API stuff to the clicky stuff so feeling encouraged! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/969794912286736385

### R1D53
Did a few minutes of coding and then spaced out on bikes for a while. More JQuery stuff which was okay but I just wasn't feeling it tonight. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/970214862528774144

### R1D54
Finished JQuery getters and animations and starting in on JQuery setters tomorrow. Yeah! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/970548369796907008

### R1D55
Tired AF and leg twitching. Falling asleep coding tonight. More fun with JQuery setters but couldn't continue another minute. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/970919090201157632

### R1D56
Adding and removing HTML elements with JQuery. Still waiting to get to the part where it talks about APIs but the syntax is making a ton ore sense now which is rad. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/971267228992724992

### R1D57
Falling asleep to JQuery add/remove classes. It's ok y stuff just a little tedious with the tweezing of pixels and look/feel. Handy stuff to know for sure tho. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/971647411834707968

### R1D58
Again falling asleep. Dreaming about a new laptop - would it be bad if I got one before the challenge was up? https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/972384832977231877

### R159
ZZZZZ. Bought my new computer today, though, and I'm psyched. Using my old Pro tonight and likely moving forward if for no other reason than the keyboard. I HATE the keyboard on the Yoga. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/972741681282891776

### R1D60
So sleepy. Finished up with the CSS hijacking and moved on to DOM traversal - cool stuff. Tomorrow begins AJAX! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/973074102993920000

### R1D61
Did more DOM stuff but fucked off on Zillow mostly if I'm being 100% honest. Anyhow, tomorrow is AJAX so psyched about that. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/973455532039131137

### R1D62
Finished DOM traversal. Tomorrow AJAX for realsies and back to the freecodecamp stuff. It's been so long! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/973802663128260608

### R1D63
Started in (finally) on AJAX. Not making sense yet and my alert function is returning 'object' 'object' which is not what I was hoping for/expecting. Hoping this starts coming together soon here. Oh, and this is the first day coding on my new laptop which is sweeeeet! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/974172408453189632

### R1D64
More JQuery and AJAX. Finally 'realized' the quote file I'm looking at is JSON and there are neat built-in JQuery tools to parse JSON. Maybe I should be using those instead of the text or XML ones? Ya think??? https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/974537354114252801

### R1D65
Made solid progress on the quote generator with the getJSON method which I didn't know existed before. I would not have been able to make any sense of how to use JQuery to modify different elements on my page without all the tutorial work I did on W3C, though, so this was no wasted effort. Having fun again and can't wait to code tomorrow! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/974893363873792000

### R1D66
Crazily long day today with skiing and mom's award thing + dinner. Still managed to make some progress with the quote generator using JQuery $.each loops but still not confident I quite have the hang of it. Will continue chipping away tomorrow. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/975268359032881152

### R1D67
Back to CSS/Bootstrap to pretty up my page. Skills already feel rusty - they faded so fast - I gotta really stay on top of this! https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/975613736001007617

### R1D68
Almost done with the quote machine but forgot the requirement to be able to tweet the quote out so need to finish that up tomorrow and then that's it - hoping it doesn't take me the whole hour to knock that out. https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/976331048526143488

### R1D69
Still messing around with trying to get the twitter link to play nice with JQuery and only show it conditionally. Trickier than I thought and also got distracted by motorcycles for a little while :) https://twitter.com/sirnixalot/status/976710908331229184
